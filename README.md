# Spring Basics IOC-Day1 Dependency Injection

Spring Dependency Injection is a way of injecting dependencies into objects. It is a feature of the Spring Framework, which allows beans to be wired together in an application context without the need for hard-coded configuration. Dependency injection can be used to inject beans, such as services, repositories, and configuration objects, into an application. It can also be used to inject properties and other values into beans.
